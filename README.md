## Lessons Learned

1. **ViteJS Setup**: Quick and efficient setup for React projects.
2. **State Management**: Efficient use of useState and useEffect for managing component state.
3. **Drag and Drop**: Implementing drag-and-drop functionality without external libraries.

## Challenges

The most difficult part was managing the drag-and-drop functionality and ensuring that the state is consistent.

## Improvements

With more time, I would implement additional features such as more complex event handling and better styling.
